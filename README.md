# Covid-Quest

The goal of each level is that Joe, the main character, needs to gather items at his local grocery store without getting infected.

There will be many obstacles in his way, but there will also be a lot of items such as masks, hand sanitizer, etc. to help him stay on track. He must complete his hunt for items in order to move on, or before he contracts the virus.
